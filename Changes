Revision history for BusyBird

0.06    2014-08-14
        [API CHANGE]
        - Timeline and StatusStorage: now contains() method accepts status objects with no "id" field.
          They are always treated as "not contained". Previously the contains() method croaked when
          ID-less statuses were passed. This behavior has been changed.
        [BUG FIX]
        - Now BusyBird::Filter exports functions only by request. Previously they were automatically exported.
        [ENHANCEMENT]
        - Add "hidden" per-timeline config parameter.
        - Add filter_grep() function to BusyBird::Filter.
        - Add make_tracking() function to BusyBird::Util.

0.05    2014-08-13
        [BUG FIX]
        - Fix test t/WebAPI.t. It failed when consecutive acks occurred at different timestamps.
        [ENHANCEMENT]
        - StatusStorage::SQLite enhancements.
        - Add get_timeline_names() method.
        - Re-implement contains() method. This boosts its performance at about 350%.
        - Use SQL::Maker's strict mode with SQL::QueryMaker. This prevents unexpected query
          injection in form of complex data structure (often as JSON strings).
          This also improves performance a little.
        [DOCUMENTATION]
        - Fix Util.pm: sort_statuses() signature was wrong.

0.04    2014-07-28
        [BUG FIX]
        - Timelines whose name contains "/" could be created and installed, but were not accessible
          via HTTP. Now those timelines can be created, but cannot be installed in Main object.
          (gh #3)
        [ENHANCEMENT]
        - Add create_timeline() method to BusyBird::Main.
        [PACKAGING]
        - BusyBird::DateTime::Format now has a separate distribution. This makes it easier
          to develop and release input/filter modules that use the Format module.

0.03    2014-07-24
        [UI CHANGE]
        - Use Web Notifications to notify new statuses.
          To disable this feature, set "timeline_web_notifications" config parameter to "off"
          (or anything other than "simple"). (gh #2 thanks to Keisuke Minami)
        - Add favicon.
        - Remove horizontal paddings around statuses in small screens. (gh #1)
        [DOCUMENTATION]
        - Minor fixes.

0.02    2014-06-18
        [BUG FIX]
        - Fix test (t/StatusStorage_SQLite.t) so BSD systems can pass it.
        - Drop dependency on CPS::Functional from cpanfile.
        [UI CHANGE]
        - All controls in timeline navbar should now fit in 320px width screen.
        - Now it doesn't set the status permalink to Twitter if the status's ID is not an integer.
        [DOCUMENTATION]
        - Add "QUICK START" section.
        - Install BusyBird under user's home directory.
