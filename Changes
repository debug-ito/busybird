Revision history for BusyBird

0.04    2014-07-28
        [BUG FIX]
        - Timelines whose name contains "/" could be created and installed, but were not accessible
          via HTTP. Now those timelines can be created, but cannot be installed in Main object.
          (gh #3)
        [ENHANCEMENT]
        - Add create_timeline() method to BusyBird::Main.
        [PACKAGING]
        - BusyBird::DateTime::Format now has a separate distribution. This makes it easier
          to develop and release input/filter modules that use the Format module.

0.03    2014-07-24
        [UI CHANGE]
        - Use Web Notifications to notify new statuses.
          To disable this feature, set "timeline_web_notifications" config parameter to "off"
          (or anything other than "simple"). (gh #2 thanks to Keisuke Minami)
        - Add favicon.
        - Remove horizontal paddings around statuses in small screens. (gh #1)
        [DOCUMENTATION]

        [UI CHANGE]
        - All controls in timeline navbar should now fit in 320px width screen.
        - Now it doesn't set the status permalink to Twitter if the status's ID is not an integer.
        [DOCUMENTATION]
        - Add "QUICK START" section.
